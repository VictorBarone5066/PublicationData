Generating this consists of four steps:
(1) Interpolate the minimum energy lattice constant from E vs V data
    Run a 1x1x1 shifted point ion relaxation at this lat const (eTol = 0.05 ev/A)
(2) Run a 2x2x2 shifted point ion relaxation from previous CONTCAR (eTol = 0.02 eV/A)
(3) Run a 3x3x3 shifted point ion relaxation from previous CONTCAR (eTol = 0.01 eV/A)
(4) Run a 4x4x4 gamma-centered scf from previous CONTCAR (now, w/ tetra. smearing method)

Shifts are by 1/4, 1/4, 1/4.
